      <h1>Examples of Common PDF Behavior</h1>
      <h2>Embedded with an <code>embed</code>:</h2>
      <embed src="example.pdf" type="application/pdf" height="600"></embed>
      <h2>Embedded with an <code>iframe</code>:</h2>
      <iframe src="example.pdf" height="600"></iframe>
      <h2>Direct link to the PDF:</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="example.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open the PDF in a New Tab</a>
      </p>
      <h2>Download link to the PDF:</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="example.pdf" download rel="noopener noreferrer">Download the PDF</a>
      </p>
      <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Both embed methods should display the PDF inline, without needing to open any new tabs
          or adding an entry to the "Downloads" window.
        </li>
        <ul>
          The direct link should open the PDF in a new tab, without needing to add an entry to the
          "Downloads" window.
        </ul>
        <li>
          The download link should enact the user's preferred download behavior for the PDF file
          type. Either opening a download dialogue, automatically saving the file to the download
          directory, or automatically opening the file in the user's software of choice.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Actual Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        In most browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.), all four methods behave as expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we were to replace the PDF with some other file that Firefox can display, like a PNG,
        <a href="png-counter-example.html">all four methods would behave as expected even in Firefox.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        But exclusively for PDFs in current versions of Firefox, it is impossible to make this webpage
        behave as expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        If PDF behavior is set to "Open in Firefox", the <code>embed</code>, <code>iframe</code>,
        and direct link behave correctly, but clicking the download link will download the file
        to the temp folder (without opening a download dialogue) <em>and</em> open it in a new tab.
        It is impossible for the webpage to open a download dialogue with this setting enabled.
