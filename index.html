      <h1>Examples of Common PDF Behavior</h1>
      <h2>Embedded with an <code>embed</code>:</h2>
      <embed src="example.pdf" type="application/pdf" height="600"></embed>
      <h2>Embedded with an <code>iframe</code>:</h2>
      <iframe src="example.pdf" height="600"></iframe>
      <h2>Direct link to the PDF:</h2>
      <a href="example.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open the PDF in a New Tab</a>
      <h2>Download link to the PDF:</h2>
      <a href="example.pdf" download rel="noopener noreferrer">Download the PDF</a>
      <h2>Expected Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Both embed methods should display the PDF inline, without needing to open any new tabs
        or adding an entry to the "Downloads" window.
      </p>
      <p>
        The direct link should open the PDF in a new tab, without needing to add an entry to the
        "Downloads" window.
      </p>
      <p>
        The download link should enact the user's preferred download behavior for the PDF file
        type. Either opening a download dialogue, automatically saving the file to the download
        directory, or automatically opening the file in the user's software of choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is how every other browser behaves, <a href="png-counter-example.html">and how Firefox
        behaves for every other displayable file type</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Actual Behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Exclusively for PDFs in current versions of Firefox, it is impossible to make this webpage
        behave as expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        If PDF behavior is set to "Open in Firefox", the <code>embed</code>, <code>iframe</code>,
        direct link, and download link behave as expected. Clicking the download link will download
        a temp file and then open it in a new tab. This matches expected behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under any other setting, the <code>embed</code> and download link behave as expected, but
        the <code>iframe</code> and direct link do not. As soon as the webpage loads, the <code>iframe</code>
        acts as if the user had attempted to download the PDF instead, opening a download dialogue or
        new software window while failing to display the PDF inline. The direct link opens a new tab which
        immediately closes itself, and then does the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, attempting to view a PDF directly in Firefox under any setting other than "Open in Firefox"
        will be treated as if the user tried to download the file.
        <a href="png-counter-example.html">This does not match the behavior of other file types, like PNGs.</a>
